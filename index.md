I'm a Staff Machine Learning Engineer at Walmart, where I lead a cross-functional team building AI applications—especially in natural language processing (NLP) and generative AI. Recently, we've been focused on developing impactful solutions for Walmart’s Legal and Corporate Affairs teams, bridging innovation with operational reality to bring prototypes into production at scale.

My journey into machine learning began with a strong academic foundation. At IISER Pune, I pursued a five-year BS-MS in Physics with a focus on Mathematics, supported by India’s prestigious INSPIRE Fellowship. My curiosity led me across diverse domains—computational quantum chemistry, ecology, game theory—all connected by a common thread: modeling complex systems. These early experiences shaped how I approach machine learning today: grounded in critical thinking, cross-domain insight, and a bias toward clarity.

I went on to study Applied Mathematics at Iowa State University, diving into linear algebra, numerical methods, optimization, and statistics. My entry into machine learning was accidental—sparked by a friend dragging me to a class, where I realized I'd been doing many of these techniques all along, just under a different name. This “aha” moment, combined with career workshops for fellow academics, made it clear that I could have greater impact by applying these skills in industry.

That decision led me to Optimus, a political consulting startup, where I built predictive models for polling, survey design, and voter turnout. I was the primary contributor to the company’s first election model—still in use today. I then joined Snagajob's search and retrieval team, where I sharpened my engineering toolkit and built production NLP systems that matched unskilled job seekers to opportunities. My work there involved developing  relevance models and production-grade ML infrastructure. At Capital One, I matured as a practitioner—building and maintaining machine learning models for credit card collections and recoveries, while learning to prioritize reliability, maintainability, and collaboration with cross-functional partners.

Today at Walmart, I lead the development of enterprise-grade GenAI applications. I’m passionate about blending research-driven rigor with practical deployment—and about solving problems that are both technically interesting and deeply useful to real people.

### Community, Collaboration, and Culture
Beyond my core responsibilities, I care deeply about creating spaces for continuous learning and shared growth. I'm a lifelong learner—not just because staying current is essential in tech, but because learning itself brings me joy and helps me stay grounded and optimistic.
At every stop in my career, I've championed community-led development: encouraging a colleague at Snagajob to start internal Python workshops, leading grassroots efforts at Capital One to improve engineering skills among data scientists, and now facilitating conversations across Walmart to help our team stay current with developments in generative AI—both within and outside the company.

One initiative I'm especially proud of is the Capital One data science hackathon I led. Alongside 12 associates, I helped launch an event that reached over 250 participants and achieved 50%+ engagement. I worked across nine data science teams and their engineering partners, gained executive buy-in, and facilitated problem-framing sessions with 100+ associates. The outcome: 30 high-impact projects aimed at automating, accelerating, or simplifying modeling workflows—six of which are now being scaled to unlock significant revenue. The experience gave me a unique window into organizational dynamics—how influence, communication, and alignment flow—and I found deep fulfillment representing the associate community in shaping the event.


### How I Work
I'm a systems thinker—whether the system is biological, mathematical, organizational, or technical. I'm a tactile learner, often shifting between high-level strategy and hands-on implementation. This practice keeps me grounded in the day-to-day while maintaining sight of the larger impact. I especially enjoy debugging data issues, finding cool patterns in data, and finding simple, clever solutions to complex problems. I have a bias toward elegant design and Occam’s razor: the simplest effective solution wins. 

I thrive in environments where the bar is high, the culture is collaborative, and one is empowered to take risks and learn. I believe deeply in creating win-win environments. I reject the zero-sum mindset and work to grow the pie, not just divide it. I find energy in empowering others—unlocking their potential, aligning incentives for collaboration, and building systems that reward generosity over competition.

Finally, I believe that clear, thoughtful communication is one of the most important (and hardest) skills in any career. It's something I work on constantly—and I know there's always room to grow.
